# VAIL Lockout Discord Bot
 A Discord.py-based Discord bot that helps users organize Minecraft-style Lockout Races in VAIL. Not affiliated with VAIL/AEXLAB. Does not integrate with the VAIL game directly. 

### What is a Lockout Race?
 A Lockout Race (often just called a "Lockout") is race between two players to complete a set number of challenges in a given game. However, both players are given the same set of challenges, and once one person does a challenge, the other player is Locked Out of completing the same one, hence the name.
