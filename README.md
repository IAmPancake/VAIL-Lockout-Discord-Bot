# VAIL Lockout Discord Bot
 A Discord.py-based Discord bot that helps users organize Minecraft-style Lockout Races in VAIL. Not affiliated with VAIL/AEXLAB. Does not integrate with the VAIL game directly. 

### What is a Lockout Race?
 A Lockout Race (often just called a "Lockout") is race between two players to complete a set number of challenges in a given game. However, both players are given the same set of challenges, and once one person does a challenge, the other player is Locked Out of completing the same one, hence the name.

This project is very much a work in progress and not meant to be used. Yet.

If you actually want to use/test this, you'll need
- Python 3 and these libraries
  - discord.py
  - asyncio
- A discord bot of your own to run the script on
  - put the bot's token in a text file called "botToken.txt" in tha same folder as the main script. just paste in the token, no formatting
- A willingness to put up with the bot breaking (hopefully not required for long)

also if you have any ideas for challenges to add to the list, DM me (@iampancake on Discord)
